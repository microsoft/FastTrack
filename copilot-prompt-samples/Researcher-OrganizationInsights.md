# Researcher-AutomationOpportunities

## 🎯 Use Case
This prompt enables the Researcher agent to analyze organizational data across multiple Microsoft 365 services to identify high-value automation opportunities for Copilot Agents. It focuses on discovering repetitive, manual, or fragmented workflows that could benefit from intelligent automation.

## 📝 Prompt
```
Analyze all available data from across my organization, including Outlook emails, calendar invites, Teams meetings (recordings, transcripts, and invites), group chats, channel messages, shared OneDrive/SharePoint files, and task-related tools like Planner or To Do. Your goal is to uncover the most valuable use cases for Copilot Agents that could automate or assist with repetitive, manual, or fragmented workflows.

Identify patterns such as repeated status updates, frequent information requests, duplicated efforts, report generation, data lookups, cross-department coordination, or tasks that require pulling information from multiple systems.

**Apply the following criteria in your analysis:**

  1. Scope
    - Begin by analyzing all available organizational data, but prioritize insights from the following departments if they show stronger automation potential:
      - [Insert your department, e.g., FastTrack, Sales, Finance, HR]
  2. Tool Focus
    - Emphasize areas where manual processes are most common in these systems:
      - Outlook, Teams, SharePoint/OneDrive, Excel, Planner, Power BI
  3. Time Savings Format
    - Report estimated time savings per task in hours per week per user or per team.
  4. Task Type Priority
    - Prioritize the following task categories:
      - Manual data entry or aggregation
      - Weekly status reporting
      - Follow-up/reminder communications
      - Frequently asked internal questions (FAQs)
      - Meeting-related tasks (preparation, summaries, follow-ups)
      - Requests that traverse multiple systems (e.g., Teams + Excel + Outlook)


**Output Format (Structured Table):**

Please provide your results in the following structured format:
Use Case Name  Source(s) Detected  Description of Pattern  Departments Involved  Estimated Time Savings  Proposed Copilot Agent Function


**Final Notes:**

  "If possible, also identify the volume or frequency of the task across the organization to help prioritize which Copilot Agents would have the highest impact."
  "Do not propose ideas that are already well-automated or covered by current Power Automate flows—focus on gaps that require intelligence, summarization, or multi-source decision support."
