# ESS ServiceNow ITSM – Get User Requests

## 📌 Overview

Extends the Microsoft Employee Self-Service (ESS) agent with the ability to list a user's **service catalog requests** (REQ numbers) from ServiceNow. The built-in ESS ITSM orchestrator only handles incident lists (INC). This sample adds a standalone flow that queries the `sc_request` table directly.

**Example conversations:**

> User: "Show me my open requests"  
> Agent: *[Numbered list of active REQ items with links]*

> User: "What requests have I submitted?"  
> Agent: *[Numbered list of all REQ items, most recently updated first]*

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `topics/ess-hr-servicenow-itsm-get-user-requests.mcs.yml` | User-facing topic — trigger phrases, state extraction, cache check, list rendering |
| `topics/ess-hr-servicenow-itsm-system-get-user-requests.mcs.yml` | System topic — routes to the standalone flow and populates the 15-min cache |
| `workflow/workflow.json` | Standalone Power Automate flow — queries `sc_request` filtered by user email + active state |
| `workflow/metadata.yml` | Flow metadata for the ESS Maker Kit push script |

## ✅ Prerequisites

- Microsoft Employee Self-Service agent (deployed)
- ServiceNow ITSM extension pack installed in Copilot Studio
- An active ServiceNow connection in Power Platform configured for on-behalf-of (invoker) auth — see [Configure OBO](#-configure-obo-required)
- ESS Maker Kit (for automated deployment via `push.py`)

---

## 🚀 Setup

> **⚠️ OBO (on-behalf-of) is required for this flow.** The ServiceNow connection uses
> `"runtimeSource": "invoker"`, so the flow calls ServiceNow **as the signed-in employee**,
> not as the maker. This keeps ServiceNow's own row-level ACLs in force — each user only sees
> requests they're entitled to. See [Configure OBO](#-configure-obo-required) below.

### Option A — ESS Maker Kit (recommended)

1. Run `/setup` in your ESS Maker Kit workspace to connect to the environment.
2. Copy `topics/` → `workspace/agents/{slug}/topics/`.
3. Copy `workflow/` → `workspace/agents/{slug}/workflows/ess-hr-servicenow-itsm-get-user-requests-{NEW-GUID}/`.
4. Replace the placeholders:
   - `{FLOW_GUID}` — in the system topic **and** `workflow/metadata.yml` (use the GUID from step 3).
   - `{SERVICENOW_CONNREF}` / `{DATAVERSE_CONNREF}` — in `workflow.json`, from `workspace/agents/{slug}/connectionreferences.mcs.yml`.
5. `python scripts/push.py`
6. **Configure OBO** — see below. Do this *before* turning the flow on.
7. Turn the flow **on** in [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com) (API activation is blocked for ServiceNow flows).
8. `python scripts/push.py --repair "Get User Requests"` to wire topic → flow.
9. Publish the agent in Copilot Studio.

### Option B — Manual

1. Import `workflow/workflow.json` into Power Automate as a new cloud flow.
2. Point the ServiceNow and Dataverse connection references at your environment's connections.
3. **Configure OBO** — see below.
4. Turn the flow on and copy its ID from the URL.
5. In Copilot Studio, create the two topics from `topics/`, replacing `{FLOW_GUID}` with that ID.
6. Publish.

### 🔐 Configure OBO (required)

The flow must call ServiceNow as the signed-in employee so ServiceNow enforces per-user access
itself. Enable parameter sharing on the ServiceNow connection backing this flow:

1. In [Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/), select **Agents** and open your agent.
2. Select **Settings**, then **Connection Settings**.
3. Find the **ServiceNow** connection row. Under **Manage**, select **See details**.
4. Open the **Connection parameters** tab.
5. Turn on **Allow permission to share parameters**.
6. Select the checkboxes for the parameters you want the user to share.

Each employee is prompted to grant permission the first time the agent uses the connection on
their behalf. Full reference:
[Share connection parameters for On-Behalf-Of (OBO) authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/authoring-connections#share-connection-parameters-for-on-behalf-of-obo-authentication).

On the ServiceNow side, ensure the OAuth application registry entry allows your Entra ID users
and that they have read access to `sc_request`.

Confirm it worked: `workflow.json` should still show `"runtimeSource": "invoker"` on the
ServiceNow connection reference after deployment. If it flips to `"embedded"`, the flow is
running as the maker — every user would see the maker's data, so reconfigure before shipping.

The `requested_for.email` filter stays in the query regardless. With OBO it's defence-in-depth
rather than the sole isolation boundary. Note that the 15-minute cache is per-user under OBO.

> **Note:** configuring OBO through the Copilot Studio UI rewrites the flow's
> `connectionReferences` block (the key typically becomes `shared_service-now-1`). If you
> re-export or re-push the flow later, re-check that block so you don't overwrite the live
> OBO binding with a stale one.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **Activation via API fails** — same as other ServiceNow standalone flows in this collection. Manual turn-on in Power Automate is required.
- **Per-user cache** — because the flow runs as the invoker, the 15-minute cache holds each employee's own results. It is not shared across users.
- **Global cache variables** — the topic uses `Global.ESS_ServiceNow_AllRequests` and `Global.ESS_ServiceNow_NextAllRequestsRefresh`. These are agent-scoped global variables — ensure they don't conflict with other topics in your agent.
- **Reference fields** — `requested_for` and `assigned_to` come back from `GetRecords` as `{display_value, link}` objects when populated (or an empty string when not set). The flow's `Flatten_Request_Records` **Select** step normalizes these to plain display-value strings across every row before mapping — if you add more reference fields to `sysparm_fields`, apply the same flatten pattern.
- **Result key** — the ServiceNow connector returns rows under `result` (ServiceNow Table API v2), *not* OData's `value`. Feeding `body(...)?['value']` to the output mapper yields `null` and fails with `A null value was found for the property named 'ServiceNowTableData'`. Keep the `?['result']` references intact if you customise this flow.
