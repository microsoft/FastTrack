## ⚙️ Default Scoring Methodology

Our risk scoring algorithm focuses on **actual SharePoint security risks** rather than architectural patterns that aren't inherently dangerous.

<div align="center">

| 🚨 Risk Factor | 📊 Default Score | 💡 Why It Matters |
|----------------|:----------------:|-------------------|
| 🔴 **High EEEU Permissions (10+)** | **+4 points** | Excessive broad internal access |
| � **Private Site + EEEU/External** | **+3 points** | Private sites shouldn't have broad access |
| 🎯 **Public Site + Sensitive Title** | **+5 points** | HR, Finance, Legal content shouldn't be public |
| 🔓 **Everyone Permissions Present** | **+3 points** | All users (including future hires) can access |
| 🔗 **Anyone Links Present** | **+2 points** | Anonymous external sharing enabled |
| 📊 **Complex Permissions (50+ users + EEEU)** | **+3 points** | High user count with broad access |
| 🏷️ **No Sensitivity Label** | **+1 point** | Missing data classification (compliance) |

</div>

> � **Customizable**: All scoring weights and thresholds can be adjusted interactively when running the tool!

### 🔄 **Methodology Update (October 2025)**

**Previous Version Issue**: Earlier versions incorrectly penalized public sites with +3 points, treating them as internet-accessible. However, SharePoint "public" sites are **internal-only by default** and not inherently risky.

**Current Focus**: The refined methodology targets actual security risks:
- ✅ **Contextual Analysis**: Private sites with broad access patterns
- ✅ **Content-Aware**: Sensitive keywords in public sites (HR, Finance, etc.)  
- ✅ **Threshold-Based**: EEEU permissions only flagged when excessive (10+)
- ✅ **Realistic Scoring**: More actionable risk prioritization

## 🛠️ Usage

### 🚀 **Risk Analysis**

```powershell
# 📊 Basic analysis with default scoring
.\Analyze-SharePointRisk.ps1 -CsvPath ".\your-permissions-report.csv"

# 🎯 Specify custom output path
.\Analyze-SharePointRisk.ps1 -CsvPath ".\your-permissions-report.csv" -OutputPath ".\custom-report.html"
```

Once you've generated your risk analysis report, use these actionable steps to improve your SharePoint security posture:

### 1️⃣ **Analyze Key Risk Indicators**

Focus on the most critical data points in your report:

- **🏢 Site Privacy Patterns**: Compare Public vs. Private site configurations
- **🌐 External Sharing Status**: Identify sites with external sharing enabled  
- **👥 EEEU & Everyone Permissions**: Look for inappropriate broad access patterns
- **🔗 Sharing Links Audit**: Review "Anyone" and "People in Org" link counts
- **⚠️ Unique Permissions**: Sites with broken inheritance (permission sprawl)

### 2️⃣ **Target High-Risk Sites First**

Prioritize sites based on these critical patterns:

- **🚨 EEEU/Everyone in Groups**: Sites with broad permissions in Members/Visitors groups
- **📊 Permission Sprawl**: High unique permissions count or excessive sharing links
- **🏛️ Classic Sites**: STS#0 templates often accumulate stale permissions over time
- **🎯 Sensitive Public Sites**: Public sites containing HR, Finance, or Legal content

### 3️⃣ **Engage Site Owners**

Delegate governance through owner empowerment:

- **📋 Site Access Reviews**: Use SharePoint Advanced Management's built-in delegation features
- **📧 Targeted Owner Reports**: Send specific site analysis to responsible owners
- **🤝 Manual Outreach**: Provide guidance and training for high-risk site owners
- **✅ Access Confirmation**: Have owners review and remove unnecessary permissions

### 4️⃣ **Apply Governance Controls**

Implement technical controls to reduce risk:

- **🚫 Remove Broad Access**: Eliminate EEEU/Everyone permissions where inappropriate
- **🌐 External Sharing Audit**: Disable external sharing for internal-only content
- **🔧 Simplify Permissions**: Reduce broken inheritance and complex permission structures
- **🏷️ Sensitivity Labels**: Apply appropriate data classification labels
- **🔒 Restricted Access Control (RAC)**: Immediate lockdown for critical sites
- **🔍 Restricted Content Discovery (RCD)**: Hide sensitive sites from Copilot and org-wide search

### 5️⃣ **Address Stale or Ownerless Sites**

Clean up abandoned content:

- **🗂️ Inactive Sites Policy**: Archive or delete sites that haven't been accessed recently
- **👤 Site Ownership Policy**: Assign new owners to "ownerless" sites
- **🔄 Regular Cleanup**: Establish recurring governance processes

### 6️⃣ **Prevent Future Oversharing**

Implement proactive controls:

- **🔗 Default Link Settings**: Change default sharing to "Specific People" only
- **🌍 Global EEEU Policy**: Consider disabling organization-wide EEEU if suitable
- **📚 User Education**: Train users on proper SharePoint sharing practices
- **🤖 Automated Governance**: Schedule recurring Data Access Governance (DAG) reports and reviews

### 7️⃣ **Document & Communicate Changes**

Ensure stakeholder alignment:

- **📢 Stakeholder Updates**: Inform users about governance changes and site lockdowns
- **📖 Access Instructions**: Provide clear guidance for requesting access to restricted sites
- **📝 Change Documentation**: Track all governance actions for compliance and audit purposes

### ⚡ **Advanced Actions** *(Optional)*

For organizations with advanced governance needs:

- **🔧 PowerShell Automation**: Schedule automated DAG reports and detailed CSV exports
- **📱 Block Download Policy**: Prevent offline file copies for highly sensitive sites
- **🚪 Conditional Access**: Implement location or device-based access restrictions
- **🛡️ DLP Integration**: Link governance policies with Data Loss Prevention controls

### 💡 **Implementation Tips**

> **🎯 Start Small**: Begin with Critical and High risk sites, then work down the priority list  
> **📊 Track Progress**: Re-run this analysis monthly to measure security posture improvements  
> **🤝 Collaborate**: Work with site owners rather than imposing changes unilaterally  
> **📈 Measure Success**: Use decreasing high-risk site counts as your primary success metric
